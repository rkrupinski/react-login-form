# react-login-form

A simple login form build with react and a bunch of other well-known libraries. Includes stuff like validation engine in a form of an [HOC](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html) + a custom-built flexbox-based grid (ooh ahh). It's also got some tests intentionally made trivial so they were always green. Some even say a company X asks candidates to build a form like this, but shhhh.

Run:

```sh
$ yarn && yarn start
```

Build:

```sh
& yarn run build
```

Test:

```sh
$ yarn test
```
